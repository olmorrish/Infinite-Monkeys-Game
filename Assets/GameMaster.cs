ENTER KENT, GLOUCESTER, AND EDMUND KENT I THOUGHT THE KING HAD MORE AFFECTED THE DUKE OF ALBANY THAN CORNWALL. GLOUCESTER IT DID ALWAYS SEEM SO TO US: BUT NOW, IN THE DIVISION OF THE KINGDOM, IT APPEARS NOT WHICH OF THE DUKES HE VALUES MOST; FOR EQUALITIES ARE SO WEIGHED, THAT CURIOSITY IN NEITHER CAN MAKE CHOICE OF EITHER'S MOIETY. KENT IS NOT THIS YOUR SON, MY LORD? GLOUCESTER HIS BREEDING, SIR, HATH BEEN AT MY CHARGE: I HAVE SO OFTEN BLUSHED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM, THAT NOW I AM BRAZED TO IT. KENT I CANNOT CONCEIVE YOU. GLOUCESTER SIR, THIS YOUNG FELLOW'S MOTHER COULD: WHEREUPON SHE GREW ROUND-WOMBED, AND HAD, INDEED, SIR, A SON FOR HER CRADLE ERE SHE HAD A HUSBAND FOR HER BED. DO YOU SMELL A FAULT? KENT I CANNOT WISH THE FAULT UNDONE, THE ISSUE OF IT BEING SO PROPER. GLOUCESTER BUT I HAVE, SIR, A SON BY ORDER OF LAW, SOME YEAR ELDER THAN THIS, WHO YET IS NO DEARER IN MY ACCOUNT: THOUGH THIS KNAVE CAME SOMETHING SAUCILY INTO THE WORLD BEFORE HE WAS SENT FOR, YET WAS HIS MOTHER FAIR; THERE WAS GOOD SPORT AT HIS MAKING, AND THE WHORESON MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED. DO YOU KNOW THIS NOBLE GENTLEMAN, EDMUND? EDMUND NO, MY LORD. GLOUCESTER MY LORD OF KENT: REMEMBER HIM HEREAFTER AS MY HONOURABLE FRIEND. EDMUND MY SERVICES TO YOUR LORDSHIP. KENT I MUST LOVE YOU, AND SUE TO KNOW YOU BETTER. EDMUND SIR, I SHALL STUDY DESERVING. GLOUCESTER HE HATH BEEN OUT NINE YEARS, AND AWAY HE SHALL AGAIN. THE KING IS COMING. SENNET. ENTER KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, AND ATTENDANTS KING LEAR ATTEND THE LORDS OF FRANCE AND BURGUNDY, GLOUCESTER. GLOUCESTER I SHALL, MY LIEGE. EXEUNT GLOUCESTER AND EDMUND KING LEAR MEANTIME WE SHALL EXPRESS OUR DARKER PURPOSE. GIVE ME THE MAP THERE. KNOW THAT WE HAVE DIVIDED IN THREE OUR KINGDOM: AND 'TIS OUR FAST INTENT TO SHAKE ALL CARES AND BUSINESS FROM OUR AGE; CONFERRING THEM ON YOUNGER STRENGTHS, WHILE WE UNBURTHEN'D CRAWL TOWARD DEATH. OUR SON OF CORNWALL, AND YOU, OUR NO LESS LOVING SON OF ALBANY, WE HAVE THIS HOUR A CONSTANT WILL TO PUBLISH OUR DAUGHTERS' SEVERAL DOWERS, THAT FUTURE STRIFE MAY BE PREVENTED NOW. THE PRINCES, FRANCE AND BURGUNDY, GREAT RIVALS IN OUR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER'S LOVE, LONG IN OUR COURT HAVE MADE THEIR AMOROUS SOJOURN, AND HERE ARE TO BE ANSWER'D. TELL ME, MY DAUGHTERS,-- SINCE NOW WE WILL DIVEST US BOTH OF RULE, INTEREST OF TERRITORY, CARES OF STATE,-- WHICH OF YOU SHALL WE SAY DOTH LOVE US MOST? THAT WE OUR LARGEST BOUNTY MAY EXTEND WHERE NATURE DOTH WITH MERIT CHALLENGE. GONERIL, OUR ELDEST-BORN, SPEAK FIRST. GONERIL SIR, I LOVE YOU MORE THAN WORDS CAN WIELD THE MATTER; DEARER THAN EYE-SIGHT, SPACE, AND LIBERTY; BEYOND WHAT CAN BE VALUED, RICH OR RARE; NO LESS THAN LIFE, WITH GRACE, HEALTH, BEAUTY, HONOUR; AS MUCH AS CHILD E'ER LOVED, OR FATHER FOUND; A LOVE THAT MAKES BREATH POOR, AND SPEECH UNABLE; BEYOND ALL MANNER OF SO MUCH I LOVE YOU. CORDELIA [ASIDE] WHAT SHALL CORDELIA DO? LOVE, AND BE SILENT. LEAR OF ALL THESE BOUNDS, EVEN FROM THIS LINE TO THIS, WITH SHADOWY FORESTS AND WITH CHAMPAINS RICH'D, WITH PLENTEOUS RIVERS AND WIDE-SKIRTED MEADS, WE MAKE THEE LADY: TO THINE AND ALBANY'S ISSUE BE THIS PERPETUAL. WHAT SAYS OUR SECOND DAUGHTER, OUR DEAREST REGAN, WIFE TO CORNWALL? SPEAK. REGAN SIR, I AM MADE OF THE SELF-SAME METAL THAT MY SISTER IS, AND PRIZE ME AT HER WORTH. IN MY TRUE HEART I FIND SHE NAMES MY VERY DEED OF LOVE; ONLY SHE COMES TOO SHORT: THAT I PROFESS MYSELF AN ENEMY TO ALL OTHER JOYS, WHICH THE MOST PRECIOUS SQUARE OF SENSE POSSESSES; AND FIND I AM ALONE FELICITATE IN YOUR DEAR HIGHNESS' LOVE. CORDELIA [ASIDE] THEN POOR CORDELIA! AND YET NOT SO; SINCE, I AM SURE, MY LOVE'S MORE RICHER THAN MY TONGUE. KING LEAR TO THEE AND THINE HEREDITARY EVER REMAIN THIS AMPLE THIRD OF OUR FAIR KINGDOM; NO LESS IN SPACE, VALIDITY, AND PLEASURE, THAN THAT CONFERR'D ON GONERIL. NOW, OUR JOY, ALTHOUGH THE LAST, NOT LEAST; TO WHOSE YOUNG LOVE THE VINES OF FRANCE AND MILK OF BURGUNDY STRIVE TO BE INTERESS'D; WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO DRAW A THIRD MORE OPULENT THAN YOUR SISTERS? SPEAK. CORDELIA NOTHING, MY LORD. KING LEAR NOTHING! CORDELIA NOTHING. KING LEAR NOTHING WILL COME OF NOTHING: SPEAK AGAIN. CORDELIA UNHAPPY THAT I AM, I CANNOT HEAVE MY HEART INTO MY MOUTH: I LOVE YOUR MAJESTY ACCORDING TO MY BOND; NOR MORE NOR LESS. KING LEAR HOW, HOW, CORDELIA! MEND YOUR SPEECH A LITTLE, LEST IT MAY MAR YOUR FORTUNES. CORDELIA GOOD MY LORD, YOU HAVE BEGOT ME, BRED ME, LOVED ME: I RETURN THOSE DUTIES BACK AS ARE RIGHT FIT, OBEY YOU, LOVE YOU, AND MOST HONOUR YOU. WHY HAVE MY SISTERS HUSBANDS, IF THEY SAY THEY LOVE YOU ALL? HAPLY, WHEN I SHALL WED, THAT LORD WHOSE HAND MUST TAKE MY PLIGHT SHALL CARRY HALF MY LOVE WITH HIM, HALF MY CARE AND DUTY: SURE, I SHALL NEVER MARRY LIKE MY SISTERS, TO LOVE MY FATHER ALL. KING LEAR BUT GOES THY HEART WITH THIS? CORDELIA AY, GOOD MY LORD. KING LEAR SO YOUNG, AND SO UNTENDER? CORDELIA SO YOUNG, MY LORD, AND TRUE. KING LEAR LET IT BE SO; THY TRUTH, THEN, BE THY DOWER: FOR, BY THE SACRED RADIANCE OF THE SUN, THE MYSTERIES OF HECATE, AND THE NIGHT; BY ALL THE OPERATION OF THE ORBS FROM WHOM WE DO EXIST, AND CEASE TO BE; HERE I DISCLAIM ALL MY PATERNAL CARE, PROPINQUITY AND PROPERTY OF BLOOD, AND AS A STRANGER TO MY HEART AND ME HOLD THEE, FROM THIS, FOR EVER. THE BARBAROUS SCYTHIAN, OR HE THAT MAKES HIS GENERATION MESSES TO GORGE HIS APPETITE, SHALL TO MY BOSOM BE AS WELL NEIGHBOUR'D, PITIED, AND RELIEVED, AS THOU MY SOMETIME DAUGHTER. KENT GOOD MY LIEGE,-- KING LEAR PEACE, KENT! COME NOT BETWEEN THE DRAGON AND HIS WRATH. I LOVED HER MOST, AND THOUGHT TO SET MY REST ON HER KIND NURSERY. HENCE, AND AVOID MY SIGHT! SO BE MY GRAVE MY PEACE, AS HERE I GIVE HER FATHER'S HEART FROM HER! CALL FRANCE; WHO STIRS? CALL BURGUNDY. CORNWALL AND ALBANY, WITH MY TWO DAUGHTERS' DOWERS DIGEST THIS THIRD: LET PRIDE, WHICH SHE CALLS PLAINNESS, MARRY HER. I DO INVEST YOU JOINTLY WITH MY POWER, PRE-EMINENCE, AND ALL THE LARGE EFFECTS THAT TROOP WITH MAJESTY. OURSELF, BY MONTHLY COURSE, WITH RESERVATION OF AN HUNDRED KNIGHTS, BY YOU TO BE SUSTAIN'D, SHALL OUR ABODE MAKE WITH YOU BY DUE TURNS. ONLY WE STILL RETAIN THE NAME, AND ALL THE ADDITIONS TO A KING; THE SWAY, REVENUE, EXECUTION OF THE REST, BELOVED SONS, BE YOURS: WHICH TO CONFIRM, THIS CORONET PART BETWIXT YOU. GIVING THE CROWN KENT ROYAL LEAR, WHOM I HAVE EVER HONOUR'D AS MY KING, LOVED AS MY FATHER, AS MY MASTER FOLLOW'D, AS MY GREAT PATRON THOUGHT ON IN MY PRAYERS,-- KING LEAR THE BOW IS BENT AND DRAWN, MAKE FROM THE SHAFT. KENT LET IT FALL RATHER, THOUGH THE FORK INVADE THE REGION OF MY HEART: BE KENT UNMANNERLY, WHEN LEAR IS MAD. WHAT WILT THOU DO, OLD MAN? THINK'ST THOU THAT DUTY SHALL HAVE DREAD TO SPEAK, WHEN POWER TO FLATTERY BOWS? TO PLAINNESS HONOUR'S BOUND, WHEN MAJESTY STOOPS TO FOLLY. REVERSE THY DOOM; AND, IN THY BEST CONSIDERATION, CHEQUE THIS HIDEOUS RASHNESS: ANSWER MY LIFE MY JUDGMENT, THY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER DOES NOT LOVE THEE LEAST; NOR ARE THOSE EMPTY-HEARTED WHOSE LOW SOUND REVERBS NO HOLLOWNESS. KING LEAR KENT, ON THY LIFE, NO MORE. KENT MY LIFE I NEVER HELD BUT AS A PAWN TO WAGE AGAINST THY ENEMIES; NOR FEAR TO LOSE IT, THY SAFETY BEING THE MOTIVE. KING LEAR OUT OF MY SIGHT! KENT SEE BETTER, LEAR; AND LET ME STILL REMAIN THE TRUE BLANK OF THINE EYE. KING LEAR NOW, BY APOLLO,-- KENT NOW, BY APOLLO, KING, THOU SWEAR'ST THY GODS IN VAIN. KING LEAR O, VASSAL! MISCREANT! LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS SWORD ALBANY CORNWALL DEAR SIR, FORBEAR. KENT DO: KILL THY PHYSICIAN, AND THE FEE BESTOW UPON THY FOUL DISEASE. REVOKE THY DOOM; OR, WHILST I CAN VENT CLAMOUR FROM MY THROAT, I'LL TELL THEE THOU DOST EVIL. KING LEAR HEAR ME, RECREANT! ON THINE ALLEGIANCE, HEAR ME! SINCE THOU HAST SOUGHT TO MAKE US BREAK OUR VOW, WHICH WE DURST NEVER YET, AND WITH STRAIN'D PRIDE TO COME BETWEEN OUR SENTENCE AND OUR POWER, WHICH NOR OUR NATURE NOR OUR PLACE CAN BEAR, OUR POTENCY MADE GOOD, TAKE THY REWARD. FIVE DAYS WE DO ALLOT THEE, FOR PROVISION TO SHIELD THEE FROM DISEASES OF THE WORLD; AND ON THE SIXTH TO TURN THY HATED BACK UPON OUR KINGDOM: IF, ON THE TENTH DAY FOLLOWING, THY BANISH'D TRUNK BE FOUND IN OUR DOMINIONS, THE MOMENT IS THY DEATH. AWAY! BY JUPITER, THIS SHALL NOT BE REVOKED. KENT FARE THEE WELL, KING: SITH THUS THOU WILT APPEAR, FREEDOM LIVES HENCE, AND BANISHMENT IS HERE. TO CORDELIA THE GODS TO THEIR DEAR SHELTER TAKE THEE, MAID, THAT JUSTLY THINK'ST, AND HAST MOST RIGHTLY SAID! TO REGAN AND GONERIL AND YOUR LARGE SPEECHES MAY YOUR DEEDS APPROVE, THAT GOOD EFFECTS MAY SPRING FROM WORDS OF LOVE. THUS KENT, O PRINCES, BIDS YOU ALL ADIEU; HE'LL SHAPE HIS OLD COURSE IN A COUNTRY NEW. EXIT FLOURISH. RE-ENTER GLOUCESTER, WITH KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, AND ATTENDANTS GLOUCESTER HERE'S FRANCE AND BURGUNDY, MY NOBLE LORD. KING LEAR MY LORD OF BURGUNDY. WE FIRST ADDRESS TOWARDS YOU, WHO WITH THIS KING HATH RIVALL'D FOR OUR DAUGHTER: WHAT, IN THE LEAST, WILL YOU REQUIRE IN PRESENT DOWER WITH HER, OR CEASE YOUR QUEST OF LOVE? BURGUNDY MOST ROYAL MAJESTY, I CRAVE NO MORE THAN WHAT YOUR HIGHNESS OFFER'D, NOR WILL YOU TENDER LESS. KING LEAR RIGHT NOBLE BURGUNDY, WHEN SHE WAS DEAR TO US, WE DID HOLD HER SO; BUT NOW HER PRICE IS FALL'N. SIR, THERE SHE STANDS: IF AUGHT WITHIN THAT LITTLE SEEMING SUBSTANCE, OR ALL OF IT, WITH OUR DISPLEASURE PIECED, AND NOTHING MORE, MAY FITLY LIKE YOUR GRACE, SHE'S THERE, AND SHE IS YOURS. BURGUNDY I KNOW NO ANSWER. KING LEAR WILL YOU, WITH THOSE INFIRMITIES SHE OWES, UNFRIENDED, NEW-ADOPTED TO OUR HATE, DOWER'D WITH OUR CURSE, AND STRANGER'D WITH OUR OATH, TAKE HER, OR LEAVE HER? BURGUNDY PARDON ME, ROYAL SIR; ELECTION MAKES NOT UP ON SUCH CONDITIONS. KING LEAR THEN LEAVE HER, SIR; FOR, BY THE POWER THAT MADE ME, I TELL YOU ALL HER WEALTH. TO KING OF FRANCE FOR YOU, GREAT KING, I WOULD NOT FROM YOUR LOVE MAKE SUCH A STRAY, TO MATCH YOU WHERE I HATE; THEREFORE BESEECH YOU TO AVERT YOUR LIKING A MORE WORTHIER WAY THAN ON A WRETCH WHOM NATURE IS ASHAMED ALMOST TO ACKNOWLEDGE HERS. KING OF FRANCE THIS IS MOST STRANGE, THAT SHE, THAT EVEN BUT NOW WAS YOUR BEST OBJECT, THE ARGUMENT OF YOUR PRAISE, BALM OF YOUR AGE, MOST BEST, MOST DEAREST, SHOULD IN THIS TRICE OF TIME COMMIT A THING SO MONSTROUS, TO DISMANTLE SO MANY FOLDS OF FAVOUR. SURE, HER OFFENCE MUST BE OF SUCH UNNATURAL DEGREE, THAT MONSTERS IT, OR YOUR FORE-VOUCH'D AFFECTION FALL'N INTO TAINT: WHICH TO BELIEVE OF HER, MUST BE A FAITH THAT REASON WITHOUT MIRACLE COULD NEVER PLANT IN ME. CORDELIA I YET BESEECH YOUR MAJESTY,-- IF FOR I WANT THAT GLIB AND OILY ART, TO SPEAK AND PURPOSE NOT; SINCE WHAT I WELL INTEND, I'LL DO'T BEFORE I SPEAK,--THAT YOU MAKE KNOWN IT IS NO VICIOUS BLOT, MURDER, OR FOULNESS, NO UNCHASTE ACTION, OR DISHONOUR'D STEP, THAT HATH DEPRIVED ME OF YOUR GRACE AND FAVOUR; BUT EVEN FOR WANT OF THAT FOR WHICH I AM RICHER, A STILL-SOLICITING EYE, AND SUCH A TONGUE AS I AM GLAD I HAVE NOT, THOUGH NOT TO HAVE IT HATH LOST ME IN YOUR LIKING. KING LEAR BETTER THOU HADST NOT BEEN BORN THAN NOT TO HAVE PLEASED ME BETTER. KING OF FRANCE IS IT BUT THIS,--A TARDINESS IN NATURE WHICH OFTEN LEAVES THE HISTORY UNSPOKE THAT IT INTENDS TO DO? MY LORD OF BURGUNDY, WHAT SAY YOU TO THE LADY? LOVE'S NOT LOVE WHEN IT IS MINGLED WITH REGARDS THAT STAND ALOOF FROM THE ENTIRE POINT. WILL YOU HAVE HER? SHE IS HERSELF A DOWRY. BURGUNDY ROYAL LEAR, GIVE BUT THAT PORTION WHICH YOURSELF PROPOSED, AND HERE I TAKE CORDELIA BY THE HAND, DUCHESS OF BURGUNDY. KING LEAR NOTHING: I HAVE SWORN; I AM FIRM. BURGUNDY I AM SORRY, THEN, YOU HAVE SO LOST A FATHER THAT YOU MUST LOSE A HUSBAND. CORDELIA PEACE BE WITH BURGUNDY! SINCE THAT RESPECTS OF FORTUNE ARE HIS LOVE, I SHALL NOT BE HIS WIFE. KING OF FRANCE FAIREST CORDELIA, THAT ART MOST RICH, BEING POOR; MOST CHOICE, FORSAKEN; AND MOST LOVED, DESPISED! THEE AND THY VIRTUES HERE I SEIZE UPON: BE IT LAWFUL I TAKE UP WHAT'S CAST AWAY. GODS, GODS! 'TIS STRANGE THAT FROM THEIR COLD'ST NEGLECT MY LOVE SHOULD KINDLE TO INFLAMED RESPECT. THY DOWERLESS DAUGHTER, KING, THROWN TO MY CHANCE, IS QUEEN OF US, OF OURS, AND OUR FAIR FRANCE: NOT ALL THE DUKES OF WATERISH BURGUNDY CAN BUY THIS UNPRIZED PRECIOUS MAID OF ME. BID THEM FAREWELL, CORDELIA, THOUGH UNKIND: THOU LOSEST HERE, A BETTER WHERE TO FIND. KING LEAR THOU HAST HER, FRANCE: LET HER BE THINE; FOR WE HAVE NO SUCH DAUGHTER, NOR SHALL EVER SEE THAT FACE OF HERS AGAIN. THEREFORE BE GONE WITHOUT OUR GRACE, OUR LOVE, OUR BENISON. COME, NOBLE BURGUNDY. FLOURISH. EXEUNT ALL BUT KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, AND CORDELIA KING OF FRANCE BID FAREWELL TO YOUR SISTERS. CORDELIA THE JEWELS OF OUR FATHER, WITH WASH'D EYES CORDELIA LEAVES YOU: I KNOW YOU WHAT YOU ARE; AND LIKE A SISTER AM MOST LOATH TO CALL YOUR FAULTS AS THEY ARE NAMED. USE WELL OUR FATHER: TO YOUR PROFESSED BOSOMS I COMMIT HIM BUT YET, ALAS, STOOD I WITHIN HIS GRACE, I WOULD PREFER HIM TO A BETTER PLACE. SO, FAREWELL TO YOU BOTH. REGAN PRESCRIBE NOT US OUR DUTIES. GONERIL LET YOUR STUDY BE TO CONTENT YOUR LORD, WHO HATH RECEIVED YOU AT FORTUNE'S ALMS. YOU HAVE OBEDIENCE SCANTED, AND WELL ARE WORTH THE WANT THAT YOU HAVE WANTED. CORDELIA TIME SHALL UNFOLD WHAT PLAITED CUNNING HIDES: WHO COVER FAULTS, AT LAST SHAME THEM DERIDES. WELL MAY YOU PROSPER! KING OF FRANCE COME, MY FAIR CORDELIA. EXEUNT KING OF FRANCE AND CORDELIA GONERIL SISTER, IT IS NOT A LITTLE I HAVE TO SAY OF WHAT MOST NEARLY APPERTAINS TO US BOTH. I THINK OUR FATHER WILL HENCE TO-NIGHT. REGAN THAT'S MOST CERTAIN, AND WITH YOU; NEXT MONTH WITH US. GONERIL YOU SEE HOW FULL OF CHANGES HIS AGE IS; THE OBSERVATION WE HAVE MADE OF IT HATH NOT BEEN LITTLE: HE ALWAYS LOVED OUR SISTER MOST; AND WITH WHAT POOR JUDGMENT HE HATH NOW CAST HER OFF APPEARS TOO GROSSLY. REGAN 'TIS THE INFIRMITY OF HIS AGE: YET HE HATH EVER BUT SLENDERLY KNOWN HIMSELF. GONERIL THE BEST AND SOUNDEST OF HIS TIME HATH BEEN BUT RASH; THEN MUST WE LOOK TO RECEIVE FROM HIS AGE, NOT ALONE THE IMPERFECTIONS OF LONG-ENGRAFFED CONDITION, BUT THEREWITHAL THE UNRULY WAYWARDNESS THAT INFIRM AND CHOLERIC YEARS BRING WITH THEM. REGAN SUCH UNCONSTANT STARTS ARE WE LIKE TO HAVE FROM HIM AS THIS OF KENT'S BANISHMENT. GONERIL THERE IS FURTHER COMPLIMENT OF LEAVETAKING BETWEEN FRANCE AND HIM. PRAY YOU, LET'S HIT TOGETHER: IF OUR FATHER CARRY AUTHORITY WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS AS HE BEARS, THIS LAST SURRENDER OF HIS WILL BUT OFFEND US. REGAN WE SHALL FURTHER THINK ON'T. GONERIL WE MUST DO SOMETHING, AND I' THE HEAT. EXEUNT SCENE II. THE EARL OF GLOUCESTER'S CASTLE. ENTER EDMUND, WITH A LETTER EDMUND THOU, NATURE, ART MY GODDESS; TO THY LAW MY SERVICES ARE BOUND. WHEREFORE SHOULD I STAND IN THE PLAGUE OF CUSTOM, AND PERMIT THE CURIOSITY OF NATIONS TO DEPRIVE ME, FOR THAT I AM SOME TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MOON-SHINES LAG OF A BROTHER? WHY BASTARD? WHEREFORE BASE? WHEN MY DIMENSIONS ARE AS WELL COMPACT, MY MIND AS GENEROUS, AND MY SHAPE AS TRUE, AS HONEST MADAM'S ISSUE? WHY BRAND THEY US WITH BASE? WITH BASENESS? BASTARDY? BASE, BASE? WHO, IN THE LUSTY STEALTH OF NATURE, TAKE MORE COMPOSITION AND FIERCE QUALITY THAN DOTH, WITHIN A DULL, STALE, TIRED BED, GO TO THE CREATING A WHOLE TRIBE OF FOPS, GOT 'TWEEN ASLEEP AND WAKE? WELL, THEN, LEGITIMATE EDGAR, I MUST HAVE YOUR LAND: OUR FATHER'S LOVE IS TO THE BASTARD EDMUND AS TO THE LEGITIMATE: FINE WORD,--LEGITIMATE! WELL, MY LEGITIMATE, IF THIS LETTER SPEED, AND MY INVENTION THRIVE, EDMUND THE BASE SHALL TOP THE LEGITIMATE. I GROW; I PROSPER: NOW, GODS, STAND UP FOR BASTARDS! ENTER GLOUCESTER GLOUCESTER KENT BANISH'D THUS! AND FRANCE IN CHOLER PARTED! AND THE KING GONE TO-NIGHT! SUBSCRIBED HIS POWER! CONFINED TO EXHIBITION! ALL THIS DONE UPON THE GAD! EDMUND, HOW NOW! WHAT NEWS? EDMUND SO PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP, NONE. PUTTING UP THE LETTER GLOUCESTER WHY SO EARNESTLY SEEK YOU TO PUT UP THAT LETTER? EDMUND I KNOW NO NEWS, MY LORD. GLOUCESTER WHAT PAPER WERE YOU READING? EDMUND NOTHING, MY LORD. GLOUCESTER NO? WHAT NEEDED, THEN, THAT TERRIBLE DISPATCH OF IT INTO YOUR POCKET? THE QUALITY OF NOTHING HATH NOT SUCH NEED TO HIDE ITSELF. LET'S SEE: COME, IF IT BE NOTHING, I SHALL NOT NEED SPECTACLES. EDMUND I BESEECH YOU, SIR, PARDON ME: IT IS A LETTER FROM MY BROTHER, THAT I HAVE NOT ALL O'ER-READ; AND FOR SO MUCH AS I HAVE PERUSED, I FIND IT NOT FIT FOR YOUR O'ER-LOOKING. GLOUCESTER GIVE ME THE LETTER, SIR. EDMUND I SHALL OFFEND, EITHER TO DETAIN OR GIVE IT. THE CONTENTS, AS IN PART I UNDERSTAND THEM, ARE TO BLAME. GLOUCESTER LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE. EDMUND I HOPE, FOR MY BROTHER'S JUSTIFICATION, HE WROTE THIS BUT AS AN ESSAY OR TASTE OF MY VIRTUE. GLOUCESTER [READS] 'THIS POLICY AND REVERENCE OF AGE MAKES THE WORLD BITTER TO THE BEST OF OUR TIMES; KEEPS OUR FORTUNES FROM US TILL OUR OLDNESS CANNOT RELISH THEM. I BEGIN TO FIND AN IDLE AND FOND BONDAGE IN THE OPPRESSION OF AGED TYRANNY; WHO SWAYS, NOT AS IT HATH POWER, BUT AS IT IS SUFFERED. COME TO ME, THAT OF THIS I MAY SPEAK MORE. IF OUR FATHER WOULD SLEEP TILL I WAKED HIM, YOU SHOULD HALF HIS REVENUE FOR EVER, AND LIVE THE BELOVED OF YOUR BROTHER, EDGAR.' HUM--CONSPIRACY!--'SLEEP TILL I WAKED HIM,--YOU SHOULD ENJOY HALF HIS REVENUE,'--MY SON EDGAR! HAD HE A HAND TO WRITE THIS? A HEART AND BRAIN TO BREED IT IN?--WHEN CAME THIS TO YOU? WHO BROUGHT IT? EDMUND IT WAS NOT BROUGHT ME, MY LORD; THERE'S THE CUNNING OF IT; I FOUND IT THROWN IN AT THE CASEMENT OF MY CLOSET. GLOUCESTER YOU KNOW THE CHARACTER TO BE YOUR BROTHER'S? EDMUND IF THE MATTER WERE GOOD, MY LORD, I DURST SWEAR IT WERE HIS; BUT, IN RESPECT OF THAT, I WOULD FAIN THINK IT WERE NOT. GLOUCESTER IT IS HIS. EDMUND IT IS HIS HAND, MY LORD; BUT I HOPE HIS HEART IS NOT IN THE CONTENTS. GLOUCESTER HATH HE NEVER HERETOFORE SOUNDED YOU IN THIS BUSINESS? EDMUND NEVER, MY LORD: BUT I HAVE HEARD HIM OFT MAINTAIN IT TO BE FIT, THAT, SONS AT PERFECT AGE, AND FATHERS DECLINING, THE FATHER SHOULD BE AS WARD TO THE SON, AND THE SON MANAGE HIS REVENUE. GLOUCESTER O VILLAIN, VILLAIN! HIS VERY OPINION IN THE LETTER! ABHORRED VILLAIN! UNNATURAL, DETESTED, BRUTISH VILLAIN! WORSE THAN BRUTISH! GO, SIRRAH, SEEK HIM; I'LL APPREHEND HIM: ABOMINABLE VILLAIN! WHERE IS HE? EDMUND I DO NOT WELL KNOW, MY LORD. IF IT SHALL PLEASE YOU TO SUSPEND YOUR INDIGNATION AGAINST MY BROTHER TILL YOU CAN DERIVE FROM HIM BETTER TESTIMONY OF HIS INTENT, YOU SHALL RUN A CERTAIN COURSE; WHERE, IF YOU VIOLENTLY PROCEED AGAINST HIM, MISTAKING HIS PURPOSE, IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT GAP IN YOUR OWN HONOUR, AND SHAKE IN PIECES THE HEART OF HIS OBEDIENCE. I DARE PAWN DOWN MY LIFE FOR HIM, THAT HE HATH WROTE THIS TO FEEL MY AFFECTION TO YOUR HONOUR, AND TO NO FURTHER PRETENCE OF DANGER. GLOUCESTER THINK YOU SO? EDMUND IF YOUR HONOUR JUDGE IT MEET, I WILL PLACE YOU WHERE YOU SHALL HEAR US CONFER OF THIS, AND BY AN AURICULAR ASSURANCE HAVE YOUR SATISFACTION; AND THAT WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DELAY THAN THIS VERY EVENING. GLOUCESTER HE CANNOT BE SUCH A MONSTER-- EDMUND NOR IS NOT, SURE. GLOUCESTER TO HIS FATHER, THAT SO TENDERLY AND ENTIRELY LOVES HIM. HEAVEN AND EARTH! EDMUND, SEEK HIM OUT: WIND ME INTO HIM, I PRAY YOU: FRAME THE BUSINESS AFTER YOUR OWN WISDOM. I WOULD UNSTATE MYSELF, TO BE IN A DUE RESOLUTION. EDMUND I WILL SEEK HIM, SIR, PRESENTLY: CONVEY THE BUSINESS AS I SHALL FIND MEANS AND ACQUAINT YOU WITHAL. GLOUCESTER THESE LATE ECLIPSES IN THE SUN AND MOON PORTEND NO GOOD TO US: THOUGH THE WISDOM OF NATURE CAN REASON IT THUS AND THUS, YET NATURE FINDS ITSELF SCOURGED BY THE SEQUENT EFFECTS: LOVE COOLS, FRIENDSHIP FALLS OFF, BROTHERS DIVIDE: IN CITIES, MUTINIES; IN COUNTRIES, DISCORD; IN PALACES, TREASON; AND THE BOND CRACKED 'TWIXT SON AND FATHER. THIS VILLAIN OF MINE COMES UNDER THE PREDICTION; THERE'S SON AGAINST FATHER: THE KING FALLS FROM BIAS OF NATURE; THERE'S FATHER AGAINST CHILD. WE HAVE SEEN THE BEST OF OUR TIME: MACHINATIONS, HOLLOWNESS, TREACHERY, AND ALL RUINOUS DISORDERS, FOLLOW US DISQUIETLY TO OUR GRAVES. FIND OUT THIS VILLAIN, EDMUND; IT SHALL LOSE THEE NOTHING; DO IT CAREFULLY. AND THE NOBLE AND TRUE-HEARTED KENT BANISHED! HIS OFFENCE, HONESTY! 'TIS STRANGE. EXIT EDMUND THIS IS THE EXCELLENT FOPPERY OF THE WORLD, THAT, WHEN WE ARE SICK IN FORTUNE,--OFTEN THE SURFEIT OF OUR OWN BEHAVIOR,--WE MAKE GUILTY OF OUR DISASTERS THE SUN, THE MOON, AND THE STARS: AS IF WE WERE VILLAINS BY NECESSITY; FOOLS BY HEAVENLY COMPULSION; KNAVES, THIEVES, AND TREACHERS, BY SPHERICAL PREDOMINANCE; DRUNKARDS, LIARS, AND ADULTERERS, BY AN ENFORCED OBEDIENCE OF PLANETARY INFLUENCE; AND ALL THAT WE ARE EVIL IN, BY A DIVINE THRUSTING ON: AN ADMIRABLE EVASION OF WHOREMASTER MAN, TO LAY HIS GOATISH DISPOSITION TO THE CHARGE OF A STAR! MY FATHER COMPOUNDED WITH MY MOTHER UNDER THE DRAGON'S TAIL; AND MY NATIVITY WAS UNDER URSA MAJOR; SO THAT IT FOLLOWS, I AM ROUGH AND LECHEROUS. TUT, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THAT I AM, HAD THE MAIDENLIEST STAR IN THE FIRMAMENT TWINKLED ON MY BASTARDIZING. EDGAR-- ENTER EDGAR AND PAT HE COMES LIKE THE CATASTROPHE OF THE OLD COMEDY: MY CUE IS VILLANOUS MELANCHOLY, WITH A SIGH LIKE TOM O' BEDLAM. O, THESE ECLIPSES DO PORTEND THESE DIVISIONS! FA, SOL, LA, MI. EDGAR HOW NOW, BROTHER EDMUND! WHAT SERIOUS CONTEMPLATION ARE YOU IN? EDMUND I AM THINKING, BROTHER, OF A PREDICTION I READ THIS OTHER DAY, WHAT SHOULD FOLLOW THESE ECLIPSES. EDGAR DO YOU BUSY YOURSELF ABOUT THAT? EDMUND I PROMISE YOU, THE EFFECTS HE WRITES OF SUCCEED UNHAPPILY; AS OF UNNATURALNESS BETWEEN THE CHILD AND THE PARENT; DEATH, DEARTH, DISSOLUTIONS OF ANCIENT AMITIES; DIVISIONS IN STATE, MENACES AND MALEDICTIONS AGAINST KING AND NOBLES; NEEDLESS DIFFIDENCES, BANISHMENT OF FRIENDS, DISSIPATION OF COHORTS, NUPTIAL BREACHES, AND I KNOW NOT WHAT. EDGAR HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A SECTARY ASTRONOMICAL? EDMUND COME, COME; WHEN SAW YOU MY FATHER LAST? EDGAR WHY, THE NIGHT GONE BY. EDMUND SPAKE YOU WITH HIM? EDGAR AY, TWO HOURS TOGETHER. EDMUND PARTED YOU IN GOOD TERMS? FOUND YOU NO DISPLEASURE IN HIM BY WORD OR COUNTENANCE? EDGAR NONE AT ALL. EDMUND BETHINK YOURSELF WHEREIN YOU MAY HAVE OFFENDED HIM: AND AT MY ENTREATY FORBEAR HIS PRESENCE TILL SOME LITTLE TIME HATH QUALIFIED THE HEAT OF HIS DISPLEASURE; WHICH AT THIS INSTANT SO RAGETH IN HIM, THAT WITH THE MISCHIEF OF YOUR PERSON IT WOULD SCARCELY ALLAY. EDGAR SOME VILLAIN HATH DONE ME WRONG. EDMUND THAT'S MY FEAR. I PRAY YOU, HAVE A CONTINENT FORBEARANCE TILL THE SPIED OF HIS RAGE GOES SLOWER; AND, AS I SAY, RETIRE WITH ME TO MY LODGING, FROM WHENCE I WILL FITLY BRING YOU TO HEAR MY LORD SPEAK: PRAY YE, GO; THERE'S MY KEY: IF YOU DO STIR ABROAD, GO ARMED. EDGAR ARMED, BROTHER! EDMUND BROTHER, I ADVISE YOU TO THE BEST; GO ARMED: I AM NO HONEST MAN IF THERE BE ANY GOOD MEANING TOWARDS YOU: I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD; BUT FAINTLY, NOTHING LIKE THE IMAGE AND HORROR OF IT: PRAY YOU, AWAY. EDGAR SHALL I HEAR FROM YOU ANON? EDMUND I DO SERVE YOU IN THIS BUSINESS. EXIT EDGAR A CREDULOUS FATHER! AND A BROTHER NOBLE, WHOSE NATURE IS SO FAR FROM DOING HARMS, THAT HE SUSPECTS NONE: ON WHOSE FOOLISH HONESTY MY PRACTISES RIDE EASY! I SEE THE BUSINESS. LET ME, IF NOT BY BIRTH, HAVE LANDS BY WIT: ALL WITH ME'S MEET THAT I CAN FASHION FIT. EXIT SCENE III. THE DUKE OF ALBANY'S PALACE. ENTER GONERIL, AND OSWALD, HER STEWARD GONERIL DID MY FATHER STRIKE MY GENTLEMAN FOR CHIDING OF HIS FOOL? OSWALD YES, MADAM. GONERIL BY DAY AND NIGHT HE WRONGS ME; EVERY HOUR HE FLASHES INTO ONE GROSS CRIME OR OTHER, THAT SETS US ALL AT ODDS: I'LL NOT ENDURE IT: HIS KNIGHTS GROW RIOTOUS, AND HIMSELF UPBRAIDS US ON EVERY TRIFLE. WHEN HE RETURNS FROM HUNTING, I WILL NOT SPEAK WITH HIM; SAY I AM SICK: IF YOU COME SLACK OF FORMER SERVICES, YOU SHALL DO WELL; THE FAULT OF IT I'LL ANSWER. OSWALD HE'S COMING, MADAM; I HEAR HIM. HORNS WITHIN GONERIL PUT ON WHAT WEARY NEGLIGENCE YOU PLEASE, YOU AND YOUR FELLOWS; I'LL HAVE IT COME TO QUESTION: IF HE DISLIKE IT, LET HIM TO OUR SISTER, WHOSE MIND AND MINE, I KNOW, IN THAT ARE ONE, NOT TO BE OVER-RULED. IDLE OLD MAN, THAT STILL WOULD MANAGE THOSE AUTHORITIES THAT HE HATH GIVEN AWAY! NOW, BY MY LIFE, OLD FOOLS ARE BABES AGAIN; AND MUST BE USED WITH CHEQUES AS FLATTERIES,--WHEN THEY ARE SEEN ABUSED. REMEMBER WHAT I TELL YOU. OSWALD WELL, MADAM. GONERIL AND LET HIS KNIGHTS HAVE COLDER LOOKS AMONG YOU; WHAT GROWS OF IT, NO MATTER; ADVISE YOUR FELLOWS SO: I WOULD BREED FROM HENCE OCCASIONS, AND I SHALL, THAT I MAY SPEAK: I'LL WRITE STRAIGHT TO MY SISTER, TO HOLD MY VERY COURSE. PREPARE FOR DINNER. EXEUNT SCENE IV. A HALL IN THE SAME. ENTER KENT, DISGUISED KENT IF BUT AS WELL I OTHER ACCENTS BORROW, THAT CAN MY SPEECH DEFUSE, MY GOOD INTENT MAY CARRY THROUGH ITSELF TO THAT FULL ISSUE FOR WHICH I RAZED MY LIKENESS. NOW, BANISH'D KENT, IF THOU CANST SERVE WHERE THOU DOST STAND CONDEMN'D, SO MAY IT COME, THY MASTER, WHOM THOU LOVEST, SHALL FIND THEE FULL OF LABOURS. HORNS WITHIN. ENTER KING LEAR, KNIGHTS, AND ATTENDANTS KING LEAR LET ME NOT STAY A JOT FOR DINNER; GO GET IT READY. EXIT AN ATTENDANT HOW NOW! WHAT ART THOU? KENT A MAN, SIR. KING LEAR WHAT DOST THOU PROFESS? WHAT WOULDST THOU WITH US? KENT I DO PROFESS TO BE NO LESS THAN I SEEM; TO SERVE HIM TRULY THAT WILL PUT ME IN TRUST: TO LOVE HIM THAT IS HONEST; TO CONVERSE WITH HIM THAT IS WISE, AND SAYS LITTLE; TO FEAR JUDGMENT; TO FIGHT WHEN I CANNOT CHOOSE; AND TO EAT NO FISH. KING LEAR WHAT ART THOU? KENT A VERY HONEST-HEARTED FELLOW, AND AS POOR AS THE KING. KING LEAR IF THOU BE AS POOR FOR A SUBJECT AS HE IS FOR A KING, THOU ART POOR ENOUGH. WHAT WOULDST THOU? KENT SERVICE. KING LEAR WHO WOULDST THOU SERVE? KENT YOU. KING LEAR DOST THOU KNOW ME, FELLOW? KENT NO, SIR; BUT YOU HAVE THAT IN YOUR COUNTENANCE WHICH I WOULD FAIN CALL MASTER. KING LEAR WHAT'S THAT? KENT AUTHORITY. KING LEAR WHAT SERVICES CANST THOU DO? KENT I CAN KEEP HONEST COUNSEL, RIDE, RUN, MAR A CURIOUS TALE IN TELLING IT, AND DELIVER A PLAIN MESSAGE BLUNTLY: THAT WHICH ORDINARY MEN ARE FIT FOR, I AM QUALIFIED IN; AND THE BEST OF ME IS DILIGENCE. KING LEAR HOW OLD ART THOU? KENT NOT SO YOUNG, SIR, TO LOVE A WOMAN FOR SINGING, NOR SO OLD TO DOTE ON HER FOR ANY THING: I HAVE YEARS ON MY BACK FORTY EIGHT. KING LEAR FOLLOW ME; THOU SHALT SERVE ME: IF I LIKE THEE NO WORSE AFTER DINNER, I WILL NOT PART FROM THEE YET. DINNER, HO, DINNER! WHERE'S MY KNAVE? MY FOOL? GO YOU, AND CALL MY FOOL HITHER. EXIT AN ATTENDANT ENTER OSWALD YOU, YOU, SIRRAH, WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER? OSWALD SO PLEASE YOU,-- EXIT KING LEAR WHAT SAYS THE FELLOW THERE? CALL THE CLOTPOLL BACK. EXIT A KNIGHT WHERE'S MY FOOL, HO? I THINK THE WORLD'S ASLEEP. RE-ENTER KNIGHT HOW NOW! WHERE'S THAT MONGREL? KNIGHT HE SAYS, MY LORD, YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOT WELL. KING LEAR WHY CAME NOT THE SLAVE BACK TO ME WHEN I CALLED HIM. KNIGHT SIR, HE ANSWERED ME IN THE ROUNDEST MANNER, HE WOULD NOT. KING LEAR HE WOULD NOT! KNIGHT MY LORD, I KNOW NOT WHAT THE MATTER IS; BUT, TO MY JUDGMENT, YOUR HIGHNESS IS NOT ENTERTAINED WITH THAT CEREMONIOUS AFFECTION AS YOU WERE WONT; THERE'S A GREAT ABATEMENT OF KINDNESS APPEARS AS WELL IN THE GENERAL DEPENDANTS AS IN THE DUKE HIMSELF ALSO AND YOUR DAUGHTER. KING LEAR HA! SAYEST THOU SO? KNIGHT I BESEECH YOU, PARDON ME, MY LORD, IF I BE MISTAKEN; FOR MY DUTY CANNOT BE SILENT WHEN I THINK YOUR HIGHNESS WRONGED.

HE WEARS CRUEL GARTERS. HORSES ARE TIED BY THE HEADS, DOGS AND BEARS BY THE NECK, MONKEYS BY THE LOINS, AND MEN BY THE LEGS: WHEN A MAN'S OVER-LUSTY AT LEGS, THEN HE WEARS WOODEN NETHER-STOCKS. KING LEAR WHAT'S HE THAT HATH SO MUCH THY PLACE MISTOOK TO SET THEE HERE? KENT IT IS BOTH HE AND SHE; YOUR SON AND DAUGHTER. KING LEAR NO. KENT YES. KING LEAR NO, I SAY. KENT I SAY, YEA.

KENT MY LORD, WHEN AT THEIR HOME I DID COMMEND YOUR HIGHNESS' LETTERS TO THEM, ERE I WAS RISEN FROM THE PLACE THAT SHOW'D MY DUTY KNEELING, CAME THERE A REEKING POST, STEW'D IN HIS HASTE, HALF BREATHLESS, PANTING FORTH FROM GONERIL HIS MISTRESS SALUTATIONS; DELIVER'D LETTERS, SPITE OF INTERMISSION, WHICH PRESENTLY THEY READ: ON WHOSE CONTENTS, THEY SUMMON'D UP THEIR MEINY, STRAIGHT TOOK HORSE; COMMANDED ME TO FOLLOW, AND ATTEND THE LEISURE OF THEIR ANSWER; GAVE ME COLD LOOKS: AND MEETING HERE THE OTHER MESSENGER, WHOSE WELCOME, I PERCEIVED, HAD POISON'D MINE,-- BEING THE VERY FELLOW THAT OF LATE DISPLAY'D SO SAUCILY AGAINST YOUR HIGHNESS,-- HAVING MORE MAN THAN WIT ABOUT ME, DREW: HE RAISED THE HOUSE WITH LOUD AND COWARD CRIES. YOUR SON AND DAUGHTER FOUND THIS TRESPASS WORTH THE SHAME WHICH HERE IT SUFFERS. FOOL WINTER'S NOT GONE YET, IF THE WILD-GEESE FLY THAT WAY. FATHERS THAT WEAR RAGS DO MAKE THEIR CHILDREN BLIND; BUT FATHERS THAT BEAR BAGS SHALL SEE THEIR CHILDREN KIND. FORTUNE, THAT ARRANT WHORE, NE'ER TURNS THE KEY TO THE POOR. BUT, FOR ALL THIS, THOU SHALT HAVE AS MANY DOLOURS FOR THY DAUGHTERS AS THOU CANST TELL IN A YEAR. KING LEAR O, HOW THIS MOTHER SWELLS UP TOWARD MY HEART!

LET GO THY HOLD WHEN A GREAT WHEEL RUNS DOWN A HILL, LEST IT BREAK THY NECK WITH FOLLOWING IT: BUT THE GREAT ONE THAT GOES UP THE HILL, LET HIM DRAW THEE AFTER. WHEN A WISE MAN GIVES THEE BETTER COUNSEL, GIVE ME MINE AGAIN: I WOULD HAVE NONE BUT KNAVES FOLLOW IT, SINCE A FOOL GIVES IT. THAT SIR WHICH SERVES AND SEEKS FOR GAIN, AND FOLLOWS BUT FOR FORM, WILL PACK WHEN IT BEGINS TO RAIN, AND LEAVE THEE IN THE STORM, BUT I WILL TARRY; THE FOOL WILL STAY, AND LET THE WISE MAN FLY: THE KNAVE TURNS FOOL THAT RUNS AWAY; THE FOOL NO KNAVE, PERDY. KENT WHERE LEARNED YOU THIS, FOOL? FOOL NOT I' THE STOCKS, FOOL. RE-ENTER KING LEAR WITH GLOUCESTER KING LEAR DENY TO SPEAK WITH ME? THEY ARE SICK? THEY ARE WEARY? THEY HAVE TRAVELL'D ALL THE NIGHT?

KING LEAR VENGEANCE! PLAGUE! DEATH! CONFUSION! FIERY? WHAT QUALITY? WHY, GLOUCESTER, GLOUCESTER, I'LD SPEAK WITH THE DUKE OF CORNWALL AND HIS WIFE. GLOUCESTER WELL, MY GOOD LORD, I HAVE INFORM'D THEM SO. KING LEAR INFORM'D THEM! DOST THOU UNDERSTAND ME, MAN? GLOUCESTER AY, MY GOOD LORD. KING LEAR THE KING WOULD SPEAK WITH CORNWALL; THE DEAR FATHER WOULD WITH HIS DAUGHTER SPEAK, COMMANDS HER SERVICE: ARE THEY INFORM'D OF THIS? MY BREATH AND BLOOD! FIERY? THE FIERY DUKE? TELL THE HOT DUKE THAT-- NO, BUT NOT YET: MAY BE HE IS NOT WELL: INFIRMITY DOTH STILL NEGLECT ALL OFFICE WHERETO OUR HEALTH IS BOUND; WE ARE NOT OURSELVES WHEN NATURE, BEING OPPRESS'D, COMMANDS THE MIND TO SUFFER WITH THE BODY: I'LL FORBEAR; AND AM FALL'N OUT WITH MY MORE HEADIER WILL, TO TAKE THE INDISPOSED AND SICKLY FIT FOR THE SOUND MAN. DEATH ON MY STATE! WHEREFORE LOOKING ON KENT SHOULD HE SIT HERE? THIS ACT PERSUADES ME THAT THIS REMOTION OF THE DUKE AND HER IS PRACTISE ONLY. GIVE ME MY SERVANT FORTH. GO TELL THE DUKE AND 'S WIFE I'LD SPEAK WITH THEM, NOW, PRESENTLY: BID THEM COME FORTH AND HEAR ME, OR AT THEIR CHAMBER-DOOR I'LL BEAT THE DRUM TILL IT CRY SLEEP TO DEATH. GLOUCESTER I WOULD HAVE ALL WELL BETWIXT YOU. EXIT KING LEAR O ME, MY HEART, MY RISING HEART! BUT, DOWN! FOOL CRY TO IT, NUNCLE, AS THE COCKNEY DID TO THE EELS WHEN SHE PUT 'EM I' THE PASTE ALIVE; SHE KNAPPED 'EM O' THE COXCOMBS WITH A STICK, AND CRIED 'DOWN, WANTONS, DOWN!'

KENT IS SET AT LIBERTY REGAN I AM GLAD TO SEE YOUR HIGHNESS. KING LEAR REGAN, I THINK YOU ARE; I KNOW WHAT REASON I HAVE TO THINK SO: IF THOU SHOULDST NOT BE GLAD, I WOULD DIVORCE ME FROM THY MOTHER'S TOMB, SEPULCHRING AN ADULTRESS. TO KENT O, ARE YOU FREE? SOME OTHER TIME FOR THAT. BELOVED REGAN, THY SISTER'S NAUGHT: O REGAN, SHE HATH TIED SHARP-TOOTH'D UNKINDNESS, LIKE A VULTURE, HERE: POINTS TO HIS HEART I CAN SCARCE SPEAK TO THEE; THOU'LT NOT BELIEVE WITH HOW DEPRAVED A QUALITY--O REGAN! REGAN I PRAY YOU, SIR, TAKE PATIENCE: I HAVE HOPE. YOU LESS KNOW HOW TO VALUE HER DESERT THAN SHE TO SCANT HER DUTY. KING LEAR SAY, HOW IS THAT? REGAN I CANNOT THINK MY SISTER IN THE LEAST WOULD FAIL HER OBLIGATION: IF, SIR, PERCHANCE SHE HAVE RESTRAIN'D THE RIOTS OF YOUR FOLLOWERS, 'TIS ON SUCH GROUND, AND TO SUCH WHOLESOME END, AS CLEARS HER FROM ALL BLAME. KING LEAR MY CURSES ON HER! REGAN O, SIR, YOU ARE OLD. NATURE IN YOU STANDS ON THE VERY VERGE OF HER CONFINE: YOU SHOULD BE RULED AND LED BY SOME DISCRETION, THAT DISCERNS YOUR STATE BETTER THAN YOU YOURSELF. THEREFORE, I PRAY YOU, THAT TO OUR SISTER YOU DO MAKE RETURN; SAY YOU HAVE WRONG'D HER, SIR. KING LEAR ASK HER FORGIVENESS? DO YOU BUT MARK HOW THIS BECOMES THE HOUSE: 'DEAR DAUGHTER, I CONFESS THAT I AM OLD; KNEELING AGE IS UNNECESSARY: ON MY KNEES I BEG THAT YOU'LL VOUCHSAFE ME RAIMENT, BED, AND FOOD.' REGAN GOOD SIR, NO MORE; THESE ARE UNSIGHTLY TRICKS: RETURN YOU TO MY SISTER. KING LEAR [RISING] NEVER, REGAN: SHE HATH ABATED ME OF HALF MY TRAIN; LOOK'D BLACK UPON ME; STRUCK ME WITH HER TONGUE, MOST SERPENT-LIKE, UPON THE VERY HEART: ALL THE STORED VENGEANCES OF HEAVEN FALL ON HER INGRATEFUL TOP!

INFECT HER BEAUTY, YOU FEN-SUCK'D FOGS, DRAWN BY THE POWERFUL SUN, TO FALL AND BLAST HER PRIDE! REGAN O THE BLEST GODS! SO WILL YOU WISH ON ME, WHEN THE RASH MOOD IS ON. KING LEAR NO, REGAN, THOU SHALT NEVER HAVE MY CURSE: THY TENDER-HEFTED NATURE SHALL NOT GIVE THEE O'ER TO HARSHNESS: HER EYES ARE FIERCE; BUT THINE DO COMFORT AND NOT BURN. 'TIS NOT IN THEE TO GRUDGE MY PLEASURES, TO CUT OFF MY TRAIN, TO BANDY HASTY WORDS, TO SCANT MY SIZES, AND IN CONCLUSION TO OPPOSE THE BOLT AGAINST MY COMING IN: THOU BETTER KNOW'ST THE OFFICES OF NATURE, BOND OF CHILDHOOD, EFFECTS OF COURTESY, DUES OF GRATITUDE; THY HALF O' THE KINGDOM HAST THOU NOT FORGOT, WHEREIN I THEE ENDOW'D. REGAN GOOD SIR, TO THE PURPOSE. KING LEAR WHO PUT MY MAN I' THE STOCKS? TUCKET WITHIN CORNWALL WHAT TRUMPET'S THAT? REGAN I KNOW'T, MY SISTER'S: THIS APPROVES HER LETTER, THAT SHE WOULD SOON BE HERE.

CORNWALL I SET HIM THERE, SIR: BUT HIS OWN DISORDERS DESERVED MUCH LESS ADVANCEMENT. KING LEAR YOU! DID YOU? REGAN I PRAY YOU, FATHER, BEING WEAK, SEEM SO. IF, TILL THE EXPIRATION OF YOUR MONTH, YOU WILL RETURN AND SOJOURN WITH MY SISTER, DISMISSING HALF YOUR TRAIN, COME THEN TO ME: I AM NOW FROM HOME, AND OUT OF THAT PROVISION WHICH SHALL BE NEEDFUL FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT. KING LEAR RETURN TO HER, AND FIFTY MEN DISMISS'D? NO, RATHER I ABJURE ALL ROOFS, AND CHOOSE TO WAGE AGAINST THE ENMITY O' THE AIR; TO BE A COMRADE WITH THE WOLF AND OWL,-- NECESSITY'S SHARP PINCH!

HOW, IN ONE HOUSE, SHOULD MANY PEOPLE, UNDER TWO COMMANDS, HOLD AMITY? 'TIS HARD; ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. GONERIL WHY MIGHT NOT YOU, MY LORD, RECEIVE ATTENDANCE FROM THOSE THAT SHE CALLS SERVANTS OR FROM MINE? REGAN WHY NOT, MY LORD? IF THEN THEY CHANCED TO SLACK YOU, WE COULD CONTROL THEM. IF YOU WILL COME TO ME,-- FOR NOW I SPY A DANGER,--I ENTREAT YOU TO BRING BUT FIVE AND TWENTY: TO NO MORE WILL I GIVE PLACE OR NOTICE. KING LEAR I GAVE YOU ALL-- REGAN AND IN GOOD TIME YOU GAVE IT. KING LEAR MADE YOU MY GUARDIANS, MY DEPOSITARIES; BUT KEPT A RESERVATION TO BE FOLLOW'D WITH SUCH A NUMBER. WHAT, MUST I COME TO YOU WITH FIVE AND TWENTY, REGAN? SAID YOU SO?

GONERIL HEAR ME, MY LORD; WHAT NEED YOU FIVE AND TWENTY, TEN, OR FIVE, TO FOLLOW IN A HOUSE WHERE TWICE SO MANY HAVE A COMMAND TO TEND YOU? REGAN WHAT NEED ONE? KING LEAR O, REASON NOT THE NEED: OUR BASEST BEGGARS ARE IN THE POOREST THING SUPERFLUOUS: ALLOW NOT NATURE MORE THAN NATURE NEEDS, MAN'S LIFE'S AS CHEAP AS BEAST'S: THOU ART A LADY; IF ONLY TO GO WARM WERE GORGEOUS, WHY, NATURE NEEDS NOT WHAT THOU GORGEOUS WEAR'ST, WHICH SCARCELY KEEPS THEE WARM. BUT, FOR TRUE NEED,-- YOU HEAVENS, GIVE ME THAT PATIENCE, PATIENCE I NEED! YOU SEE ME HERE, YOU GODS, A POOR OLD MAN, AS FULL OF GRIEF AS AGE; WRETCHED IN BOTH! IF IT BE YOU THAT STIR THESE DAUGHTERS' HEARTS AGAINST THEIR FATHER, FOOL ME NOT SO MUCH TO BEAR IT TAMELY; TOUCH ME WITH NOBLE ANGER, AND LET NOT WOMEN'S WEAPONS, WATER-DROPS, STAIN MY MAN'S CHEEKS!

ALBANY THIS SHOWS YOU ARE ABOVE, YOU JUSTICERS, THAT THESE OUR NETHER CRIMES SO SPEEDILY CAN VENGE! BUT, O POOR GLOUCESTER! LOST HE HIS OTHER EYE? MESSENGER BOTH, BOTH, MY LORD.

THE FRENCH CAMP NEAR DOVER. ENTER KENT AND A GENTLEMAN KENT WHY THE KING OF FRANCE IS SO SUDDENLY GONE BACK KNOW YOU THE REASON? GENTLEMAN SOMETHING HE LEFT IMPERFECT IN THE STATE, WHICH SINCE HIS COMING FORTH IS THOUGHT OF; WHICH IMPORTS TO THE KINGDOM SO MUCH FEAR AND DANGER, THAT HIS PERSONAL RETURN WAS MOST REQUIRED AND NECESSARY. KENT WHO HATH HE LEFT BEHIND HIM GENERAL? GENTLEMAN THE MARSHAL OF FRANCE, MONSIEUR LA FAR. KENT DID YOUR LETTERS PIERCE THE QUEEN TO ANY DEMONSTRATION OF GRIEF? GENTLEMAN AY, SIR; SHE TOOK THEM, READ THEM IN MY PRESENCE; AND NOW AND THEN AN AMPLE TEAR TRILL'D DOWN HER DELICATE CHEEK: IT SEEM'D SHE WAS A QUEEN OVER HER PASSION; WHO, MOST REBEL-LIKE, SOUGHT TO BE KING O'ER HER. KENT O, THEN IT MOVED HER. GENTLEMAN NOT TO A RAGE: PATIENCE AND SORROW STROVE WHO SHOULD EXPRESS HER GOODLIEST. YOU HAVE SEEN SUNSHINE AND RAIN AT ONCE: HER SMILES AND TEARS WERE LIKE A BETTER WAY: THOSE HAPPY SMILETS, THAT PLAY'D ON HER RIPE LIP, SEEM'D NOT TO KNOW WHAT GUESTS WERE IN HER EYES; WHICH PARTED THENCE, AS PEARLS FROM DIAMONDS DROPP'D. IN BRIEF, SORROW WOULD BE A RARITY MOST BELOVED, IF ALL COULD SO BECOME IT. KENT MADE SHE NO VERBAL QUESTION? GENTLEMAN 'FAITH, ONCE OR TWICE SHE HEAVED THE NAME OF 'FATHER' PANTINGLY FORTH, AS IF IT PRESS'D HER HEART: CRIED 'SISTERS! SISTERS! SHAME OF LADIES! SISTERS! KENT! FATHER! SISTERS! WHAT, I' THE STORM? I' THE NIGHT? LET PITY NOT BE BELIEVED!' THERE SHE SHOOK THE HOLY WATER FROM HER HEAVENLY EYES, AND CLAMOUR MOISTEN'D: THEN AWAY SHE STARTED TO DEAL WITH GRIEF ALONE. KENT IT IS THE STARS, THE STARS ABOVE US, GOVERN OUR CONDITIONS; ELSE ONE SELF MATE AND MATE COULD NOT BEGET SUCH DIFFERENT ISSUES. YOU SPOKE NOT WITH HER SINCE? GENTLEMAN NO. KENT WAS THIS BEFORE THE KING RETURN'D? GENTLEMAN NO, SINCE. KENT WELL, SIR, THE POOR DISTRESSED LEAR'S I' THE TOWN; WHO SOMETIME, IN HIS BETTER TUNE, REMEMBERS WHAT WE ARE COME ABOUT, AND BY NO MEANS WILL YIELD TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER. GENTLEMAN WHY, GOOD SIR? KENT A SOVEREIGN SHAME SO ELBOWS HIM: HIS OWN UNKINDNESS, THAT STRIPP'D HER FROM HIS BENEDICTION, TURN'D HER TO FOREIGN CASUALTIES, GAVE HER DEAR RIGHTS TO HIS DOG-HEARTED DAUGHTERS, THESE THINGS STING HIS MIND SO VENOMOUSLY, THAT BURNING SHAME DETAINS HIM FROM CORDELIA. GENTLEMAN ALACK, POOR GENTLEMAN! KENT OF ALBANY'S AND CORNWALL'S POWERS YOU HEARD NOT? GENTLEMAN 'TIS SO, THEY ARE AFOOT. KENT WELL, SIR, I'LL BRING YOU TO OUR MASTER LEAR, AND LEAVE YOU TO ATTEND HIM: SOME DEAR CAUSE WILL IN CONCEALMENT WRAP ME UP AWHILE; WHEN I AM KNOWN ARIGHT, YOU SHALL NOT GRIEVE LENDING ME THIS ACQUAINTANCE.

GLOUCESTER A POOR UNFORTUNATE BEGGAR. EDGAR AS I STOOD HERE BELOW, METHOUGHT HIS EYES WERE TWO FULL MOONS; HE HAD A THOUSAND NOSES, HORNS WHELK'D AND WAVED LIKE THE ENRIDGED SEA: IT WAS SOME FIEND; THEREFORE, THOU HAPPY FATHER, THINK THAT THE CLEAREST GODS, WHO MAKE THEM HONOURS OF MEN'S IMPOSSIBILITIES, HAVE PRESERVED THEE. GLOUCESTER I DO REMEMBER NOW: HENCEFORTH I'LL BEAR AFFLICTION TILL IT DO CRY OUT ITSELF 'ENOUGH, ENOUGH,' AND DIE.

THEY FLATTERED ME LIKE A DOG; AND TOLD ME I HAD WHITE HAIRS IN MY BEARD ERE THE BLACK ONES WERE THERE. TO SAY 'AY' AND 'NO' TO EVERY THING THAT I SAID!--'AY' AND 'NO' TOO WAS NO GOOD DIVINITY. WHEN THE RAIN CAME TO WET ME ONCE, AND THE WIND TO MAKE ME CHATTER; WHEN THE THUNDER WOULD NOT PEACE AT MY BIDDING; THERE I FOUND 'EM, THERE I SMELT 'EM OUT. GO TO, THEY ARE NOT MEN O' THEIR WORDS: THEY TOLD ME I WAS EVERY THING; 'TIS A LIE, I AM NOT AGUE-PROOF. GLOUCESTER THE TRICK OF THAT VOICE I DO WELL REMEMBER: IS 'T NOT THE KING?

NONE DOES OFFEND, NONE, I SAY, NONE; I'LL ABLE 'EM: TAKE THAT OF ME, MY FRIEND, WHO HAVE THE POWER TO SEAL THE ACCUSER'S LIPS.

GONERIL THE BEST AND SOUNDEST OF HIS TIME HATH BEEN BUT RASH; THEN MUST WE LOOK TO RECEIVE FROM HIS AGE, NOT ALONE THE IMPERFECTIONS OF LONG-ENGRAFFED CONDITION, BUT THEREWITHAL THE UNRULY WAYWARDNESS THAT INFIRM AND CHOLERIC YEARS BRING WITH THEM. REGAN SUCH UNCONSTANT STARTS ARE WE LIKE TO HAVE FROM HIM AS THIS OF KENT'S BANISHMENT. GONERIL THERE IS FURTHER COMPLIMENT OF LEAVETAKING BETWEEN FRANCE AND HIM.PRAY YOU, LET'S HIT TOGETHER: IF OUR FATHER CARRY AUTHORITY WITH SUCH DISPOSITIONS AS HE BEARS, THIS LAST SURRENDER OF HIS WILL BUT OFFEND US.
